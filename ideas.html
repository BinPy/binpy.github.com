		<h1 style="font-size:160%;">1. Circuit Design Software</h1>
		<p style="margin-left:3%;">
			<strong>Description : </strong> Creating a GUI using python-qt where you can directly drag and drop elemts like wires , gates etc and connect them to our python code. This will reduce the amount of programming to be done by the user by a huge margin so that even amature programmers and even the hardware designers can start off easily.
			<br><br>

			<strong>Requirements : </strong>Experience in Qt and python.

		<h1 style="font-size:160%;">2. Simulation</h1>
		<p style="margin-left:3%;">
			<strong>Description : </strong> Create a graphic simulation of the built circuit that compiles the code and displays the features of the circuit in real-time just like softwares xylinx and model-sim.  
			<br><br>
			<strong>Requirements : </strong>Experience in Qt and python.

		<h1 style="font-size:160%;">3. Extending Libraries</h1>
		<p style="margin-left:3%;">
			<strong>Description : </strong> The scope of algorithms and gates used in hardware design are numerous.Some basic work has been done and important gates and algorithms have been implemented but we would like to further expand our libraries to various other aspects of digital electronics. 
			<br><br>
			<strong>Requirements : </strong>Experience in python and hardware design.

	<div><p style="font-size:120%">These ideas are just for reference but we would like developers to come up with their own ideas on various algorithms and circuits that are being used in harware design so that user can start developing on top of these.</p></div>
